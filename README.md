# Grid_Decentralization_Project
Final Year Project

This project explores decentralized energy solutions as a means to enhance grid stability, promote sustainable power distribution, and support underserved communities across Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania.
Our approach integrates localized renewable energy sources, modular infrastructure, and smart grid technologies, aimed at reducing dependency on centralized energy systems and increasing resilience.
